## ðŸ§  Syntax Guide (v0.1)

```lm
~! This is a comment

let name = "Lumira"
printos("Hello,", name)  ~! also works with +

let age = inscan("Enter your age: ")

check: age >= 18
    printos("You are eligible!")
elsecheck:
    printos("You are not eligible.")

let val = "123"
let number = toint(val)
let pi = tofloat("3.14")
printos(datatype(pi))  ~! prints: float
